To protect a word from being orphaned, place `&nbsp;` before the last word in a sentence.

Like this:
`If a sentence is forced to wrap, it will wrap wherever it is allowed to&nbsp;break.`


If you want to keep a word with a hyphen from wrapping, place it in a `<nobr></nobr>` tag. 

Like this: `<nobr>high-tech</nobr>`


To force a line break in some copy, add a `<br>` tag where you want the break. To simulate a new paragraph, do it twice `<br><br>`
