Pre-launched on Mashable, “Anthem” was shared 92K times in under 48 hours. The NY Times called it, “charming,” Business Insider called it, “Everything that’s good about America,” and the incumbent agency called it a violation of Ari’s non-compete (kidding).",

Efficient. Easy to use. A way to make down as form-fitting as nature intended. It was time to put the age-old inefficiencies to rest. Time to give voice to world’s first and only fully seamless down fabric.",
